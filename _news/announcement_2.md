Dear friends and colleagues,

I am thrilled to share a significant milestone in my journey. After four transformative years at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, I have successfully completed my undergraduate studies.

My time at BITS Pilani has been nothing short of exceptional. I've had the privilege to learn from some of the brightest minds, tackle challenging academic projects, and engage in enriching extracurricular activities. The experiences, friendships, and knowledge gained during my time here have been invaluable, shaping me both personally and professionally.

As I step into the next phase of my life, I am excited to announce that I will be joining Target Corporation as a Software Engineer. This marks the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in my career, and I am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I have acquired during my education to contribute to Target's mission.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my professors, mentors, friends, and family for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my academic journey. Without your encouragement, I would not have reached this point.

I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in my role at Target Corporation and am committed to making the most of this incredible opportunity. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a software engineer, and I'm grateful for the experiences that have brought me to this point.

Thank you all for being a part of my journey so far, and I hope to make you proud as I embark on this new adventure.

Warm regards,
Abhinav.
