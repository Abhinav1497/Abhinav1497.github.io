Hello there, welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm a software engineer with a passion for crafting digital solutions that make life a little smoother. My journey started at BITS Pilani, where I immersed myself in the world of Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing my masters at Stony Brook University endeavouring through new challenges and aspects of life.

While working as a Software Development Engineer at Target, where I've been lucky enough to be part of some amazing projects. From enhancing microservice scalability to making payment systems more seamless, every line of code I write aims to create a positive impact.

During my time as a Software Research Intern at UST Global, I got my hands on some intriguing tech like HashGraph. It's these experiences that keep the fire of curiosity burning in me.

I've tinkered with everything from complex log maintenance with Raft instances to ensuring that threads play nice together in microservice architectures.

One of my research stints with Prof. Bharat M Deshpande at BITS Pilani opened my eyes to the fascinating world of Web Data Mining and Collaborative Filtering. Personalizing web searches felt like sculpting digital experiences.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the realms of JAVA, C++, and a toolkit of technical goodies like SpringBoot, Apache Kafka, and REST API.

My journey is backed by certifications in Data Structures and Algorithms and Object Oriented Programming in JAVA. But hey, let's not make it all about workâ€”feel free to join me in this adventure of bytes and creativity!
